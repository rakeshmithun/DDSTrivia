# DDS Trivia
The intent of the DDS Trivia project is automate the allocation roster and also the record/score keeping process.

## TODO/Future state:
1. Automate the roster reminder process: Email to be sent to the team DL as a reminder thats it's their turn to host trivia for the coming week.
2. Record keeping - Update the last week's podium scores as well team scores
3. Ability to add new teams/update roster and scores
